Table 1
+ parameter values are taken from modelling papers, which I expect reference experimental papers.  We should try to get closer to experimental sources
+ δ has units per day, τ should be included with units of days
+ p has units virus per cell per day
+ estimated is not the correct word, since that implies data and fitting.  These should have sources.

Table 2
+ initial conditions are functions (all states are now functions, not just S and V).  Are we using constant functions for ICs?
